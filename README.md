# Home Automation System

This is a web-based home automation system that allows you to control your home appliances remotely. It includes a frontend and a backend, both written in HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP AND PHP. The frontend is built using BootStrap, while the backend is built using PHP. And it doesn't include a database yet. We use keyValuePairs.txt instead of a database.
